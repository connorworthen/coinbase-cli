# Coinbase::Cli
Welcome to my first CLI. In this program, you will be able to view different tradeable cryptocurrencies, their current rates, descriptions, and facts about cryptocurrencies. To run the program do 'bundle install', then bin/coinbase-cli. After those two steps, the program will load to the main menu. In the menu, there are 6 options. All of these come with directions on both how to find (ex. current prices on Bitcoin), but also how to return to the main menu and exit the program. From the main menu, entering 1, will take you to current prices, 2, their descriptions, 3, facts about cryptocurrencies, 4, how to buy and trade cryptocurrencies, 5, menu, and 6, exit. Thank you for using my program! Happy investing!
